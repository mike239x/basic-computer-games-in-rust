This is a part of [https://github.com/coding-horror/basic-computer-games](the bigger project) that aims to rework [BASIC Computer Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games) to code games from there with modern languages.
Since Rust is not on the list of languages for that project, I made this repo.
